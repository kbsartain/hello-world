    <h1>The evolution of the Web</h1>
        <h2>The early years</h2>
            <p>You were born so simple, small, and innocent in all your monochrome and fixed-width glory.  Maybe you looked immature by the standards of what you have become, but you looked beautiful to me.
      Anyone that knew the world before you couldn't help but marvel in your existence.  You were a gift to the world.  You grew quickly with all your silly tables and blinky fonts.  
      I could not have been more proud than the day you brought home scrolling text and 8-bit audio.
            </p>
        <h2>The awkward teenage years</h2>
            <p>
                Becoming a teenager is nothing to be ashamed of, but your version 4 of everything, I mean what were you thinking?  Sure that .css looked great.. on 0.3% of browsers that 
                you tested against.  Ok, I promised that I wouldn't bring that up.
                Then there was the Flash and the Silverlight, whatever that is.  You were doing so well, but did every page have to take 38 minutes to load?
                I don't know what sites you were going to, but the computer kept getting all those pop-up's and nigerian prince offers.  That was just awful.

        <h2>Graduation</h2>
            <p>
                Web, look at you now, all dressed up in your 5.0.  You work on every browser, and very quickly I might add.  You work on every device I need you to and adjust to my needs.
                You load on everything, every time and I'm proud of you.  I can't wait to see what you do next. 
            </p>
